# EastAsiaSeas

MITgcm regional coastal configuration of East Asian Seas (105E-127E, 5N-41N),
from Vietnam to Korean peninsulas, including the South China, East China, and
Yellow Seas. The configuration is being developed for the study of coastal
physical and biogeochemical processes, including river plumes, internal waves,
and intrusion of Kuroshio eddies through Luzon Strait.
